# Rhythm
Rhythm is a project to explore new ideas in UI for programming. It is very much a work in progress and is not yet useful for anything.

There is a demo available [here](https://rhythm-demo.pages.dev). Note that it has only been tested in Chromium-based browsers.

### Development mode
```
npm install
npx shadow-cljs watch app
```
start a ClojureScript REPL
```
npx shadow-cljs browser-repl
```
### Building for production

```
npx shadow-cljs release prod
```
