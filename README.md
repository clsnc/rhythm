# Rhythm
Rhythm was a project to explore new ideas in UI for programming. It never reached alpha, but taught me plenty during development. The ideas and lessons are now being applied to [Frajure](https://github.com/clsnc/frajure), the project that supersedes it.

There is a demo available [here](https://rhythm-demo.pages.dev). Note that it has only been tested in Chromium-based browsers.

### Development mode
```
npm install
npx shadow-cljs watch app
```
start a ClojureScript REPL
```
npx shadow-cljs browser-repl
```
### Building for production

```
npx shadow-cljs release prod
```
